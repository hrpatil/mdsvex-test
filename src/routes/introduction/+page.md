# Introduction

Welcome to this documentation site built with SvelteKit and mdsvex.

## What is SvelteKit?

SvelteKit is a framework for building web applications of all sizes, with a beautiful development experience and flexible filesystem-based routing. It is built on Svelte, which is a lightweight, compiler-focused JavaScript framework that writes less boilerplate code.

## Features

- **Filesystem-based routing** - Create pages by adding files to your `routes` directory
- **Server and client rendering** - Render content on the server for better SEO, or on the client for faster interactions
- **API routes** - Build your backend alongside your frontend
- **Data loading** - Load data before rendering pages with `+page.server.js`
- **Forms and actions** - Handle form submissions with `+page.server.js` actions

## Getting Started

To start building with SvelteKit:

1. Create a new project with `npm create svelte@latest my-app`
2. Install dependencies with `npm install`
3. Start the development server with `npm run dev`
4. Open `http://localhost:5173` in your browser

That's it! You're ready to build amazing web applications.
