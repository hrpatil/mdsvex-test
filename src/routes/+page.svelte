	<h2>Getting Started</h2>
	<p>
		SvelteKit is a framework for building web applications of all sizes, with a beautiful
		development experience and flexible filesystem-based routing. It's built on top of Svelte, a
		compile-time web component framework that generates highly optimized JavaScript.
	</p>

	<h3>Prerequisites</h3>
	<p>Before diving into SvelteKit, you should have:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Basic knowledge of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript</li>
		<li>Familiarity with modern JavaScript (ES6+)</li>
		<li>Understanding of component-based architecture</li>
		<li>Experience with package managers like npm or yarn</li>
	</ul>

	<h3>Installation</h3>
	<p>
		Getting started with SvelteKit is straightforward. You can create a new project using the
		official CLI tool or by cloning a starter template.
	</p>

	<h2>Core Concepts</h2>
	<p>
		Understanding these fundamental concepts will help you build better applications with SvelteKit.
		Each concept builds upon the previous one, creating a solid foundation for your development
		journey.
	</p>

	<h3>Reactivity</h3>
	<p>
		Svelte's reactivity system is one of its most powerful features. Unlike other frameworks that
		use a virtual DOM, Svelte compiles your components into highly efficient imperative code that
		surgically updates the DOM when state changes.
	</p>

	<h3>Components</h3>
	<p>
		Components are the building blocks of Svelte applications. They encapsulate HTML, CSS, and
		JavaScript into reusable pieces that can be composed to create complex user interfaces.
	</p>

	<h3>Stores</h3>
	<p>
		Svelte stores provide a simple and powerful way to manage state that needs to be shared across
		multiple components. They offer a clean API for reactive programming patterns.
	</p>

	<h2>Architecture Overview</h2>
	<p>
		SvelteKit follows a specific architectural pattern that promotes best practices and makes your
		applications more maintainable and scalable.
	</p>

	<h3>File-based Routing</h3>
	<p>
		One of SvelteKit's most beloved features is its file-based routing system. Routes are defined by
		the structure of files in your src/routes directory, making it intuitive and easy to organize
		your application.
	</p>

	<h3>Server-side Rendering</h3>
	<p>
		SvelteKit provides built-in server-side rendering (SSR) capabilities, which improve performance
		and SEO. You can also choose to pre-render pages at build time for even better performance.
	</p>

	<h3>API Routes</h3>
	<p>
		You can create API endpoints alongside your pages, making it easy to build full-stack
		applications without needing a separate backend server.
	</p>

	<h2>Performance Benefits</h2>
	<p>
		SvelteKit applications are fast by default. Here's why our framework delivers exceptional
		performance across all metrics that matter for modern web applications.
	</p>

	<h3>Compile-time Optimizations</h3>
	<p>
		Unlike runtime frameworks, Svelte performs optimizations at compile time, resulting in smaller
		bundle sizes and faster runtime performance. This means your users download less JavaScript and
		experience faster page loads.
	</p>

	<h3>Bundle Splitting</h3>
	<p>
		SvelteKit automatically splits your code into optimally-sized chunks, ensuring users only
		download the JavaScript they need for the current page. This reduces initial load times and
		improves the overall user experience.
	</p>

	<h2>Development Experience</h2>
	<p>
		SvelteKit is designed with developer experience in mind. From hot module replacement to
		excellent TypeScript support, every aspect of the development workflow has been carefully
		considered.
	</p>

	<h3>Hot Module Replacement</h3>
	<p>
		Changes to your code are reflected instantly in the browser without losing component state,
		making development faster and more enjoyable.
	</p>

	<h3>TypeScript Support</h3>
	<p>
		Full TypeScript support is built-in, providing excellent type safety and developer tooling
		without any additional configuration required.
	</p>
